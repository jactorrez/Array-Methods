## Array Methods
### Working with filter, sort, map, and reduce

A small, and fun, project from the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. To start off the new year, I wanted to dive deeper into Javascript by learning and using the new and more advanced (and sometimes obscure!) syntax introduced in ES6 in small projects. In the process I also wanted to get more familiar with vanilla Javascript. There's no better way to start than with the \#Javascript30 challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects in 30 days.

This project was a fun one. I've worked with filter, sort, map, and reduce in the past, but this one was a fun challenge that allowed me to understand and work with these methods a lot more.
